I will graduate from university within 2 years and will graduate from Intro to Programming nanodegree. This is my second nanodegree and I really love learning new stuff. 
I'm not working right now but have some industrial engineering internship experiences and also worked as a freelance team guide at Udacity
I know Python, C++, HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. I think these skills will help me a lot during this nanodegree
As I'm not working right now, I have plenty of time to study this nanodegree, which will also increase my focus and efficiency on this nanodegree
